In the dictionary of the "project file", what we care about in  the "src" file, as it contains the java     class files of the project. In "src/" are four files "chart", "com", "compare" and "GUI".These four files are packet files in Eclipse. Other files in "project file/"     are the config files created by the Eclipse, and we put it here in case that the user need to run the project.
