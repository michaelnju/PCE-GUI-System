# Packet-Classfication-Evaluation-GUI-System
This is a GUI system written in java with jigloo and jfreechart plugins that used to evaluate the packet classfication . 
We have three directory files here:                                                                                                                                   
In the "executable file" you can see a executable java file 'PCEvalutionSystem.jar', when you double-click on it  you can see the system running.
.The "project file" is the java project file of this system. In the dictionary of the "project file", what we care about is the "src" file, as it contains the java     class files of the project. In "src/" there are four files which are "chart", "com", "compare" and "GUI".These four files are packet files in Eclipse. Other files in "project file/" are the config files created by the Eclipse, and we put it here in case that the user need to run the project.
The "explanation file" used to explain the codes and show how to operate the system. The "Operation manual" show the steps when using the system and "SourceCode" ex    plain the code.
